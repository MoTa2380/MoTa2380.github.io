## About Me

### Education

I am currently a student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), majoring in **Electrical Engineering**, with a GPA of `18.41 out of 20`. My GPA for the last five semesters is `19.01 out of 20`.

### Research Interests

My primary interests are in machine learning, privacy in machine learning, trustworthy AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also passionate about computer vision and image processing.


### Working Experience

I am currently working at **MCILab** as part of the **LLM team**, where we are training a large language model (LLM) for the Persian language. One of our major challenges is data collection, as available data in Persian is quite limited. We are also working on the evaluation of the LLM and aligning it to ensure it does not respond to certain types of questions. 

Our LLM can be accessed at [this link](https://llm.mcinext.org/). We offer three models:

1. **Ahoran** – A Persian language model with 8 billion parameters, developed using Meta's Llama 3 and continual pretraining by MCILab. It can answer general knowledge questions.
   
2. **Sialk** – A Persian language model with 1.3 billion parameters, fully trained by MCILab. It can also answer general knowledge questions.

3. **Ava** – A Persian language model with 13 billion parameters, based on Cohere's Aya model, fine-tuned by MCILab. It is specialized in answering general knowledge and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) questions.



### Background

I was born in a small village in Iran where we didn’t have many resources, including good schools or [internet](https://www.khabaronline.ir/news/1454024/%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3-%DA%A9%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%A2%D9%86%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B1-%D9%87%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%85-%DA%A9%D9%86%DA%A9%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B6%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B4%DA%A9%D9%87-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA). But I had a dream to study and make something of myself. So, I worked hard and got into a top high school called Mofateh High School through an entrance exam. It was challenging at first because my previous
school wasn’t very advanced. But I didn’t give up and studied really hard. I did so well that I was the top student for three years in a row. Then, I prepared for the Iranian national university entrance exam. I did really well and ranked `8th out of 40,000` people in my region, and 169th out of all 160,000 participants. This allowed me to go to Sharif University of Technology, the best university for engineering in Iran. I started my Electrical Engineering studies there in 2020.
