## About Me

### Education
I am currently a student at Sharif University of Technology, majoring in Electrical Engineering, with a GPA of 18.41 out of 20. My GPA for the last five semesters is 19.01 out of 20.

### Research Interests
My primary interests are in machine learning, privacy in machine learning, trustworthy AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also passionate about computer vision and image processing.

### Background
I grew up in a village with limited facilities, poor internet connectivity, and a less-than-ideal school environment. Despite these challenges, I studied diligently and was accepted into Mofateh High School in Jahrom through an entrance exam. This school offered better opportunities, and although my background was weaker compared to many of my peers, I worked hard to close the gap. I ranked first in my class for three consecutive years, with a GPA of 19.93 out of 20. My efforts paid off when I ranked 8th out of about 49,000 participants in my province and 169th nationwide out of approximately 140,000 students in the national university entrance exam (Konkur).
